# Berghain

🕺 Welcome to Berghain: Where Only Valid Browsers Get the Backend Party Started! 🎉

Berghain is your trusty SPOE-Agent, guarding the entrance to the backend like a seasoned bouncer. This Go and
HAProxy-powered tool ensures that only the coolest and most valid browsers can access the exclusive party happening on
the other side.

With Berghain in charge, you can be confident that your backend is reserved for the true VIPs of the internet, keeping
out any uninvited guests. It's like the bouncer of the web world, ensuring that your resources are reserved for the
browsers that really know how to dance!

## Example setup with HAProxy
To start berghain locally you can follow these easy steps:

For Debian / Ubuntu: apt install npm

0. Run `npm install` inside `web/`
1. Run `npm run build` inside `web/`
2. Run `haproxy -f examples/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`
3. Run `go run ./cmd/spop/. -config cmd/spop/config.yaml`

For production use, generate a random `secret` to place in the Berghain configuration file using `openssl rand -base64 32`.

## Log privacy

The Go SPOE agent writes a 128-bit HMAC source identifier instead of a plaintext client IP address.
It is stable until the configured `secret` changes and uses a key derived separately from cookie
authentication. The example HAProxy access log likewise replaces `%ci` with a 256-bit SHA-2
pseudonym keyed by `BERGHAIN_SOURCE_LOG_KEY`. Set that environment variable to an independent,
high-entropy production secret; the checked-in value is only a local-development fallback.

These identifiers are pseudonymous personal data, not anonymous values. An operator with the
relevant secret can test candidate addresses, particularly across the IPv4 address space.
Hostnames, request paths, and client-provided support IDs can also appear in logs.

## Running with Docker

To run the project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the services:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Test App: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Make sure to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system before running these commands.
